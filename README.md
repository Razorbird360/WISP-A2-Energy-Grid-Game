## 🎮 How to Play

- **Drag & Drop**: Place energy sources on the 5x5 grid by dragging from the sidebar
- **Budget Management**: Start with $100M to spend across 5 years - no additional income!
- **Balance Metrics**: Keep emissions low, reliability high, and maintain public approval
- **Terrain Matters**: Different terrains affect costs, efficiency, and approval ratings
- **Random Events**: Face challenges like storms, subsidies, and scandals each year
- **Strategic Planning**: Choose the right energy mix for optimal results

## 🔋 Energy Sources

- **Coal**: Cheap but high emissions and low approval
- **Gas**: Moderate cost and emissions
- **Wind**: Clean energy with weather dependency
- **Solar**: Popular renewable with moderate reliability
- **Nuclear**: Expensive but extremely reliable and clean
- **Hydro**: Balanced renewable option

## 🗺️ Terrain Effects

Each terrain type modifies costs, efficiency, and approval:
- **Mountains**: Great for hydro and wind
- **Desert**: Perfect for solar, terrible for hydro
- **City**: Higher costs but approval bonus
- **Offshore**: Excellent wind but expensive
- **And many more!**

## 🎯 Winning Strategy

Aim for high public approval and low emissions while maintaining grid reliability. Different terrains offer strategic advantages - plan your placements carefully!
